# MLP-Classifier-K-NN---Compare-Performance-
Fit an MLP classifier to the Universal Bank Data  Clean and prepare the data (you’ve done this a few times now)  Fit an MLP classifier to the data  Experiment with different combinations neurons and hidden layers.  Show at least 3  Analyze performance of each of the three models on validation data  Fit a k-nn model  •use GridSearchCV to find optimal k  •analyze performance of model on validation data  Discuss findings  •How does the predictive performance of k-nn model compare to the MLP classifier?  •Which model takes less time to train? Which model is faster at prediction?
